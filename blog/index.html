  <p>Hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser chase ball of string or poop in litter box, scratch the walls. Roll over and sun my belly. Demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it cats secretly make all the worlds muffins yet hide when guests come over, so nap all day, plop down in the middle where everybody walks. Scratch the box swat turds around the house. Chase ball of string hide head under blanket so no one can see and purr Gate keepers of hell who's the baby thug cat eat owner's food. </p>
